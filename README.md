this is the project on driver drowsiness detection.I build this this project in teachable machine and exported this model and run this in google colab it was running succesfully.The workflow of this model is like it will be capturing frame by frame for first 5 frame if the driver is drowsy it will give a alert sound and even if the driver is woking to the alert sound then will enable to vehicle to vehicle communication which i'm curently working on it.

setup:
import both converted keras and saved model into the code whether you are running locally or in google colab.
then import the audio.mp3 file into the code
run all the code from the starting
